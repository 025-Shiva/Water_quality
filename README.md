Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

Studied and Analyzed the Water Quality Prediction to applying ML models and present my insights.

Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.

Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Bagging, and Boosting.

Compared the results to recommend the best Machine learning model.
